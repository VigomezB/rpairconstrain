Description: Tools to randomly pair values from two numeric vectors while
  enforcing inequality constraints (>= or >), with and without replacement.
  The methods are motivated by applications in income and tax data
  reconstruction, where components must be combined randomly while
  respecting accounting and logical consistency constraints.
